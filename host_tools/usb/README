LF1000 USB Testing

Introduction
------------

See http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/index.html#gadgets for info on testing.

testusb.c comes from http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/testusb.c

test.sh comes from http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest/test.sh

Building
--------

These tests are run on the USB host to test our USB device.  The device must be
built with the zero gadget as opposed to mass storage or something else.  So,
you can not run these tests with the default release configuration.  The host
must be a linux host with the usbtest driver available.  My default Ubuntu
system has this natively.  The test program is testusb.c.  Build and install
testusb and testusb_all in $PREFIX/bin by running ./install.sh

Running
-------

Plug in the target over USB.  Run individual tests by plug

   $ testusb -a -t9 -c 100

Run all the tests like this:

   $ testusb_all
