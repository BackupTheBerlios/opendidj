These are some tests done by using open() and read() on a JFFS2 image rather
than reading via the NAND controller on the target.  The goal is to:
1) parse the image
2) find a desired file from a path
3) "cat" it to an output buffer

This code is heavily based on jffs2dump.c, and uses some header files from the
mtd-utils directory.

Files:
	jffs2cat.c -- simple test program using open() and read()
	libjffs2.c -- the actual JFFS2 routines, derived from jffs2dump.c and
                      intended to be moved into lightning-boot shortly.
